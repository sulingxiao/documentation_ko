Please download the release version or build from the source code.

If you complete the upgrade before the [414100] block height, you don't need to do anything else.

If you do not complete the upgrade before the [414100] block height, the synchronization data may fail due to the inability to process the voting request.

You need to :

1. Download the v1.0.3 Prometheus-3 release version or build from the source code.
2. Delete your local Chain folder and synchronize the block data again.
