### <a name="Ontology-did"></a>Ontology DID <sup>[top⇈](#ontology-infrastructure)</sup>
> Ontology DID(Also: ONT ID) is a decentralized identification protocol which based on W3C DID specifications. It supports collaborative services such as distributed and diversified ownership confirmation, identification, and authentication of various entities including individuals, legal entities, objects, and contents. ONT ID establishes a cryptographically-based digital identity for each entity, allowing self-sovereign of data authorization and ownership confirmation, which makes the identity and data truly assets that the user can control. ONT ID has the characteristics of decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, security and ease of use.

### <a name="Ontology-python-sdk"></a>Ontology Python SDK <sup>[top⇈](#ontology-infrastructure)</sup>
> Ontology Python SDK function consists of four parts, RPC interface, wallet, asset, and identity. For RPC interface, it is responsible to interact with the Ontology blockchain, including querying and sending transactions. For wallet, it manages wallet file and store the encrypted private key of the asset account and identity. The function of asset can transfer ONT/ONG, check account balance, withdraw ONT/ONG and so on. The function of identity can send request to register ONT ID and get DDO object. In addition to these four parts, SDK also support constructing, deploying, and invoking a smart contract.
